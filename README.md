# System Design
## 1. User Service
### Architecture: 
- Microservice with REST or GraphQL API for user management. 
### Design Patterns:
#### Authentication & Authorization: 
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
#### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): 
- Separate read and write models for user data. Commands for registration and profile updates; queries for retrieving profile information.
#### Factory Pattern: 
- For creating user objects during registration, depending on user type (admin, operator, customer).
### Database:
#### Relational Database (SQL): 
- PostgreSQL or MySQL, as user data requires ACID properties for consistency.
#### Sharding: 
- Distribute user data across multiple database instances if the number of users is very large.
#### Caching: 
- Use Redis or Memcached for session tokens and frequently accessed user profiles.
## 2. Motorbike Service
### Architecture: 
- Stateless microservice that interacts with other services (User, Parking, Check-In/Out).
### Design Patterns:
#### Repository Pattern: 
- Abstract the logic for interacting with the motorbike data to make the service more testable and maintainable.
#### Observer Pattern: 
- Notify other services (Parking, Check-In/Out) when a motorbike's status changes.
### Database:
#### NoSQL (Document-based): 
- MongoDB, since the motorbike data can grow rapidly, and NoSQL databases are well-suited for fast writes and scalability.
#### Indexes: 
- Index fields such as LicensePlate, BikeId, and OwnerId to optimize search and lookup operations.
#### Caching: 
- Redis for frequently accessed data, like available motorbike statuses.
## 3. Parking Service
### Architecture: 
- Microservice with REST API for managing parking spots and availability. 
### Design Patterns:
#### State Pattern: 
- Model parking spots as different states (available, occupied, reserved). This is useful when changing states frequently, e.g., when motorbikes check in/out.
#### Factory Pattern: 
- For allocating different types of parking spots (e.g., regular, premium) based on demand.
#### Circuit Breaker: 
- Use a circuit breaker to handle external services like geolocation APIs (for locations). Database:
#### Key-Value Store: 
- Redis or DynamoDB for real-time tracking of parking spot availability, ensuring fast updates and reads.
#### Sharded Relational Database: 
- PostgreSQL or MySQL, sharded by location to avoid bottlenecks when managing large amounts of parking data.
#### Geospatial Indexing: 
- For parking locations, use a database that supports geospatial queries, like PostgreSQL with PostGIS or MongoDB.
## 4. Check-In/Check-Out Service
### Architecture: 
- Core service for handling real-time check-in/out transactions. It needs to be event-driven and scalable. 
### Design Patterns:
#### Event-Driven Architecture: 
- Use Event Sourcing to capture each check-in and check-out as an event. This allows for auditing and replaying events if needed.
#### Saga Pattern: 
- For coordinating complex check-in/out operations across services (e.g., ParkingService, MotorbikeService) in a distributed system.
#### Command Pattern: 
- For encapsulating check-in/out operations as commands, making it easy to extend or rollback operations. ### Database:
#### NoSQL: 
- Use Cassandra or DynamoDB for fast, scalable writes. This is essential for logging high-frequency check-in/out events.
#### Time-Series Database: 
- InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for tracking check-in/out events over time for reporting purposes.
#### Write Optimization: 
- Use Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) or append-only storage mechanisms to ensure data is always persisted quickly.
#### Indexing: 
- Index fields like BikeId, UserId, and CheckInTime to optimize event querying.
## 5. Notification Service
### Architecture: 
- Event-driven microservice that listens to events (e.g., check-in/out) and sends notifications. 
### Design Patterns:
#### Observer/Publish-Subscribe Pattern: 
- Other services (Check-In/Out, User) publish events, and the Notification Service subscribes to send messages in response.
#### Adapter Pattern: 
- Use adapters for different notification channels (email, SMS, push notifications). Database:
#### Message Queue: 
- Use RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or AWS SNS/SQS to handle the delivery of notifications asynchronously.
#### NoSQL: 
- DynamoDB or MongoDB to store user preferences for notifications.
#### Caching: 
- Redis for storing active notification preferences and states to avoid frequent database lookups.
## 6. Payment Service (Optional)
### Architecture: 
- Stateless microservice that processes payments and calculates charges based on parking duration. 
### Design Patterns:
#### Strategy Pattern: 
- To select different payment methods (credit card, digital wallets, etc.) based on user preference.
#### Transaction Pattern: 
- Ensure the entire payment process is atomic and failure-tolerant using a Two-Phase Commit or Distributed Transaction pattern.
#### Retry Pattern: 
- To handle payment gateway failures. 
### Database:
#### Relational Database (SQL): 
- PostgreSQL or MySQL for managing payment records and invoices. Use ACID-compliant transactions to ensure data consistency.
#### Audit Log: 
- Use a separate table or database (e.g., NoSQL) to log all payment transactions for auditing and reconciliation.
## 7. Reporting & Analytics Service
### Architecture: 
- Batch-processing or stream-processing service for aggregating and analyzing data from other services.
### Design Patterns:
#### Event Sourcing: 
- Collect and aggregate events from the Check-In/Out service to generate insights.
#### Batch Processing: 
- Use MapReduce (e.g., in Hadoop or Spark) for large-scale data aggregation and reporting.
#### Data Pipeline: 
- Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to gather data from multiple services and store it in a centralized data warehouse for analysis. 
### Database:
#### Data Warehouse: 
- Use Redshift, BigQuery, or Snowflake for large-scale data storage and fast querying of historical check-in/out data.
#### Time-Series Database: 
- InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for storing and querying time-series data, like the number of check-ins per hour.
#### OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): 
- Use OLAP cubes for fast data aggregation and querying across multiple dimensions (time, location, motorbike).
